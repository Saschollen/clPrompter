# CL Prompt â€” Prompt IBM i CL Commands

This is a CL Prompter for VS CODE running the vscode-for-ibmi extension, commonly known as Code4i or Code4IBMi
To prompt a CL command, open a CLP or CLLE source member, place the cursor on the line with the command you want to prompt,
then press F4 or use the context ("right-click") menu if that's easier.

It is currently only available internally. It doesn't work well enough at the moment to use so do not install the extension.
Once it reaches a point where I feel it is working "good enough" I will push it to the marketplace for download.
